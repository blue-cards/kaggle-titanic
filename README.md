# kaggle-titanic
## a memory of my first kaggle compitition
## what I do
first, I use numpy and pandas, also, sklearns

then, I make the titles and the sex and someting like this turn into numbers

which means that I can esaylly push it into numpy

then I thorw out port, because it can hardly find the rules

after that, I choose Random Forest, which the best choice in this time

for more information you can find in main.ipynb

thanks JNUAI push me to this project, and thanks everyone who help me in any ways
